## Management & Information Systems 

These are some of the assignments and projects that I've worked on or currently working on in the Masters in Management & Information Systems program at Western Oregon University. 

The program is a mix of both business and technology. Here you will find a mixture of assignments from small coding projects to powerpoint slides discussing and analyzing businesses.
