## Planning 

	1. Before I tackled this homework, it was really important for me to understand how to setup correctly for the MVC Web Application. 
	2. The path I took to create the base of this project was New Project -> ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework) -> MVC -> Create!
	3. The first thing I did was to create the framework for the UI, I made sure I added tags and names so that I could access them via Controller
