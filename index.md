### HW4:

This week we dived deeper into using ASP.NET MVC 5. By using methods such as "GET" and "POST" I was able to learn how to send data from the browser to the server and from the server to the browser, in different ways, so I can see the options I have when creating dynamic web pages with forms and form data
