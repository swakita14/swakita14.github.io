## HW Overview

For this homework we created a MVC Application that uses multi-table, relational database instance. We added CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to the list of items. We used AJAX to show the current bids on the item, with a time interval set. Finally we wrote LINQ queries to show the top 10 bids, ordered by timestamp.
