This is my second assignment for this class. For this assignement I needed to first understand branching in Git. My next objective was to learn and use Javascript, and the it's library jQuery. I created an HTML form, and by using Javascript, I was able to select and modify elements in the DOM and repond to events.

2. Once I decided on what to do, I started drawing out a layout for the page, and how it would look after the form submission
